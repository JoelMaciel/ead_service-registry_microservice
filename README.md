# About the project.

### Eureka Server, part of Netflix OSS, is a service registry that is mainly used in microservice
### architectures to locate services dynamically. It is part of Spring Cloud Netflix, a collection of
### tools that integrate the Netflix OSS libraries with the Spring ecosystem. Microservices register
### with Eureka Server with a unique identifier and their location (URI). This allows other services
### to discover and communicate with them without the need for fixed URLs.


## Technology used :
-  JAVA 11
